# Infrared images generatio and image fusion
## Introduction
Thermal cameras are expensive and have a narrow field of view, resulting in a lack of infrared image datasets at present. Therefore, utilizing rich and diverse visible light to generate infrared images is of great importance. This project utilizes existing visible and infrared image data to train generate adversarial networks. Based on the characteristics of the task of generating infrared images from visible light, this project has added content loss, and the generation effect is improved by referencing Transformer's self loss on the basis of adversarial loss and cyclic consistency loss. In addition to using visible light to generate infrared images in augmenting the number of infrared data, image fusion technology can also be used to enhance the image quality of infrared image data.
